- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicoeos
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and eventually machine learning. My interest are wide but mainly are strategy, creativity and somehow fashion. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analaysis, I have a chemical engineering background, and used Python previously to do data analaysis of thermochemical properties but I want to expand to other appplications. Within this I worked with linear regressions and logistic regression as well as other models but it feels rusty now. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on analysing data and pictures to draw conclusions and creative strategies
- 📫 How to reach me: send me a message
